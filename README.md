# Detecting-Linguesting-Clues-From-Fake-Reviews-and-Classifying-Fake-Reviews
This project tries to analyze linguistic clues from fake review datasets. It explores two types of linguistic clues, general linguistic clues, found using n-gram of words and ngram of pos tagging, and several linguistic clues from deceptive language clues. The performance of general linguistic clues such as n-gram of words and tags are measured using the prediction accuracy of three classifiers: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine and Random Forrest classifier. The impact of deceptive language clues on fake reviews is explored using the r-squared value of a linear regression algorithm. The performance is compared against a Deep Recurrent Convolutional Classifier. Initial analysis shows using linguistic clues directly does not outperforms deep learning model. The main contribution of the project is the direction a new researcher can take while exploring linguistic features for text classifications and some deceptive language specific features.
